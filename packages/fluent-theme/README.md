# @uifabric/fluent-theme

**This package is deprecated and replaced by `@fluentui/theme` package.**

You can find Fluent colors, fonts, effects and other constants for Fluent UI React components in `@fluentui/theme`.

Note that in `@fluentui/react` (or `office-ui-fabric-react`) version 7, components use the Fluent theme by default, so manually applying the Fluent theme is no longer necessary.
